# Task 1 — Set Up the Working Directory

## Goal

Create and enter the dedicated Deployment lab directory.

# Task 2 — Create the Basic Deployment

## Goal

Create a two-replica NGINX Deployment and verify the automatically managed ReplicaSet and Pods.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 02 — Completed basic `nginx-deployment.yaml` showing two replicas and the initial NGINX image

![Task 2.A](<screenshots/week 12-assignment 03-screenshot -02.png>).

#### Screenshot 03 — Successful apply output and verification output showing the Deployment, its automatically created ReplicaSet, and two Pods with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`

![Task 2.B](<screenshots/week 12-assignment 03-screenshot -03.png>).

---

# Task 3 — Configure the RollingUpdate Strategy

## Goal

Configure RollingUpdate to maintain the desired available replica count during an image update.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 04 — Updated YAML showing `RollingUpdate`, `maxSurge: 1`, and `maxUnavailable: 0`

![Task 3.A](<screenshots/week 12-assignment 03-screenshot -03.png>).

---

#### Screenshot 05 — Successful apply output and Deployment details showing the configured rolling-update strategy

![Task 3.B](<screenshots/week 12-assignment 03-screenshot -05.png>).

---

# Task 4 — Perform and Roll Back an Image Update

## Goal

Update NGINX to 1.23.1, observe the rollout, and return to the previous stable revision.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 06 — Image-update command and rollout status showing successful completion

![Task 4.A](<screenshots/week 12-assignment 03-screenshot -06.png>).

---

#### Screenshot 07 — ReplicaSet output showing the previous and updated ReplicaSets, and Deployment details showing `nginx:1.23.1`

![Task 4.B](<screenshots/week 12-assignment 03-screenshot -07.png>).

---

#### Screenshot 08 — Rollback command and rollout status showing successful completion

![Task 4.C](<screenshots/week 12-assignment 03-screenshot -08.png>).

---

#### Screenshot 09 — Rollout history and Deployment details showing the restored `nginx:1.21.1` image

![Task 4.D](<screenshots/week 12-assignment 03-screenshot -09.png>).

---

# Task 5 — Scale the Deployment

## Goal

Scale the workload to five replicas and return it to two.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Scale-up command and output showing five Pods with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`

![Task 5.A](<screenshots/week 12-assignment 03-screenshot -10.png>).

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Scale-down command and output showing the final two Pods with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`

![Task 5.B](<screenshots/week 12-assignment 03-screenshot -11.png>).

# Task 6 — Share Your Kubernetes Deployment Progress on WhatsApp Status

## Goal

Share your Kubernetes Deployment learning progress on WhatsApp Status, including your generated DMI leaderboard progress link.

### Steps

1. Go to the DMI Leaderboard.
2. Find your name and select **Share your progress**.
3. Click the **WhatsApp icon**.
4. Copy the automatically generated leaderboard message containing your rank and progress link.
5. Open WhatsApp and go to **Updates**.
6. Create a new text Status.
7. Copy and paste the message below.
8. Insert the generated leaderboard message in the indicated place.
9. Review and publish your Status.

### WhatsApp Status Message

I practiced Kubernetes Deployments as part of my DevOps learning journey! 🚀

Today, I deployed NGINX, configured rolling updates, updated the container image, and rolled back to the previous version.

I also scaled my Deployment from two Pods to five and back to two!

# Lab Summary

Write a short note explaining how Deployments manage ReplicaSets, perform rolling updates and rollbacks, and scale Pods.

In this assignment, I learned how Kubernetes Deployments manage ReplicaSets and Pods while supporting rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling.

I created an NGINX Deployment with two replicas and configured the RollingUpdate strategy using maxSurge: 1 and maxUnavailable: 0. These settings allow Kubernetes to gradually replace Pods while maintaining the desired number of available replicas.

I updated the NGINX image from version 1.21.1 to 1.23.1 and verified that the rollout completed successfully. I then performed a rollback to restore the previous image version.

Finally, I scaled the Deployment from two Pods to five and back to two. This helped me understand how Kubernetes automatically manages ReplicaSets, maintains the desired number of Pods, and simplifies application updates and scaling.
